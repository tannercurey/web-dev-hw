# **Project 2: The Instructable**
## _By Tanner Curey_

**Overview:**

I chose to do my instructable on making **Caprese**, the tasty _Italian_ appetizer that combines bread, tomato, mozzarella, basil, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. This instructable will take you through the process of finding ingredients, preparing the ingredients, and finally, creating a masterpiece.

**My Experiences:**

**_Part 1:_**
I referred to the resources many times for assistance but overall I found it very doable to build this instructable. I feel someone competent and enjoy the process but I still rely on using the resources for directions. I look forward to memorizing tags and becoming more efficient. I had a problem with the indentation on my "Directions" but after some help from the issues page I was able to figure out that I had forgot to close one of my unordered list tags. I'm quickly learning how careful of detail I must be to avoid even small setbacks. I also attempted to add color to my webpage but I did not figure it out quite the way I wanted to. I found it helpful to leave comments, particularly if you have to step away from the computer for awhile. I now realize that I did more than I needed to do for this assignment and I had to remove some of my work.

**_Part 2:_**
I'm feeling a lot more comfortable and confident using HTML. I'm at the point where I feel like I can always find a way to get the task at hand completed, even if it takes a lot of trial/error, research, or checking the issues board. I am trying to improve at remembering certain commands without looking back at the resources. While I definitely have improved, I still like to use the resources quite often to double check that i'm entering the right commands, especially as we learn new commands every week. Overall, I felt like I struggled less than I did on past weeks assignments. While this weeks project was still very time consuming, I never really felt truly stumped this week so i'll take that as a sign of improvement. I enjoyed developing new pages and aspects to my site, it feels good to see the work i'm putting in turn into a functional website.

**_Part 3:_**
In completion of this project I feel much more accomplished in my HTML endeavors. I now feel confident in controlling the apprearance of my html webpage, i.e. background&text color, fonts, placement of text and links, symbology, etc. It feels good to create a functional website with multiple pages that has a decent appearance. I have continued to have less struggle with each step of this project. At first I felt that I would spend way too much time on figuring out one small action. Now I feel confident that I can always trouble shoot an issue that comes up in my coding and I spend a lot less time solving the issue. I did spend quite a bit of time on the **iframe** and the **self-hosted video**. I enjoyed messing around with the colors, placement, and overall design of my pages. Overtime, this process has only become smoother and more enjoyable for me and i'm now looking forward to delving into CSS.
