# **Project 2: The Instructable**
## _By Tanner Curey_

**Overview:**

I chose to do my instructable on making Caprese, the tasty Italian appetizer that combines bread, tomato, mozzarella, basil, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. I referred to the resources many times for assistance but overall I found it very doable to build this instructable. I feel someone competent and enjoy the process but I still rely on using the resources for directions. I look forward to memorizing tags and becoming more efficient. I had a problem with the indentation on my "Directions" but after some help from the issues page I was able to figure out that I had forgot to close one of my unordered list tags. I'm quickly learning how careful of detail I must be to avoid even small setbacks. I also attempted to add color to my webpage but I did not figure it out quite the way I wanted to. I found it helpful to leave comments, particularly if you have to step away from the computer for awhile.
