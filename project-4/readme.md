# **Project 4:**
## _By Tanner Curey_

I explored various displays at different screen sizes. Fixing my main image to adapt to various scree displays was challenging at first but after playing around with the code for awhile I was able to get it to adapt appropriately.

**RWD Goals:**
* Maintaing a clean look with an attractive color scheme
* Optimize the site for all screen sizes in an attractive manner
* Create a NavBar that is responsive
* Add an image that is Responsive
* Provide facts, examples, and stats of why RWD is important
