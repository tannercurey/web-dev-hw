      <p>Oh, when I was seventeen <br />
        My mother said to me <br />
        "Don't stop imagining. The day that you do is the day that you die" <br />
        Now I pull a one-ton carriage <br />
        Instead of the horses, grazing along <br />
        I was having fun <br />
        We were all having fun </p>
