# **My First README.md**

## **Tanner Curey**

**Hi!**

This is my first time doing any real coding. While I have been confused during this process, I've learned that with commitment and perseverance I am able to complete the task at hand.

_What I've Learned_

1. I've learned basic markdown commands.
2. I learned how to organize files.
3. I also begain to gain an understanding of html.

_My Goals_

* To independently write my own code and make it live on my own site.
* To learn markdown well enough to not rely on the cheat sheat.

`Inline Code`
`This is a foreign language`

**Conclusion:**

This process requires a lot of trial and error and patience but i'm surviving. I struggled with general concept of connecting the github desktop to atom initally but I eventually realized that they had already been connected. At times I also struggles with markdown by making some minor character errors that throw off the intended design. I found HTML and the live site to be much easier than this readme portion of the assignment. Perhaps it's because of the practice in part 1 that better prepared me for part2, maybe it is getting a little easier afterall?

I actually really enjoyed making the live site and I felt accomplished once I finally finished. I hope to become more efficient and careful when completing our homework. At times I skipped over small steps or tried to do too many tasks at once and that usually resulted in backtracking. The issues tab proved to be helpful to be many times when I hit a bump in the road. Snooping and the "Elements" tab on Chrome also seem like they will be helpful tools in the future.

**The Wayback Machine**

The wayback machine was really intersting, I had never heard about it or used it before. I looked at the npr website. In 1997 the npr site looked increibly limited and basic but also not very user friendly. Over the years this site has become very popular and is a great example of a clean, functional, user friendly, and navigable site. I also looked at espn.com in 1999 and noticed how busy it was with hyperlinks and text but very few images. In 2010 the general design of espn.com looked fairly similar to the way it does in 2017. The major change I notice is that today's site is cleaner and less busy with a white background and less color.
